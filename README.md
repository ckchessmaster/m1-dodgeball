<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is the first game in my year long game a month challenge. This game is a as the title suggests a dodgeball game. Players will form teams and throw balls. If a player is hit they are eliminitated. The last team standing wins. Time permitting I will add extra features such as power-ups or even abilities.</p>
